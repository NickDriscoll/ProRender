Handle window resizing
Look into VK_KHR_display for fullscreen display

Super short guide to smooth swapchain resizing
1. Use old_swapchain when creating a new swapchain
2. Never resize in the drawing thread, only call resize in the  OS 'resize callback/event'
3. In the OS 'resize callback/even', repaint the scene.
4. Never delete resources (images, views, framebuffers) in the resize. Instead put it in a delayed-deletion-queue. This will delete it when its no longer being used in a couple of frames
5. Use dynamic viewport/scissor, use imageless framebuffer, and re-record command buffers every frame
6. If the items in 4 and 5 are implemented, the resize function will not need to call vkDeviceWaitIdle()
You put the swapchain resize in your "os callback to tell me that the window size has changed"

C++ for VSCode is shit:
    Rename symbol is slow and doesn't fully work sometimes
